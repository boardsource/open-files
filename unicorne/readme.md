## Unicorne Standard Plate
Here are the open files for the Unicorne Standard Plates.
All the other plates are derived from this one and you should be able to modify this to make your own.

The only important things to know when making a plate for the unicorne are:

* **DO NOT** change the edge cuts they fit in the case perfectly.
* **YOU MUST** Order your plate at 1.2mm thickness.

If you follow these rules you should be able to make your own plates for the unicorne and come out with something pretty good. 

I have exported the GERBERS as SVG if you wanted to cut them out of something else too.
